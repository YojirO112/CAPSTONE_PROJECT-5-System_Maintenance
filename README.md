## 📖 Project Overview

This project is **Capstone Project 5** from the LinuxOS & LSP module:  
**“Bash Scripting Suite for System Maintenance”**

It is a collection of **Bash scripts** that automate common system maintenance tasks — such as file backups, temporary file cleanup, and log monitoring — combined into a single, menu-driven console tool.  

The project has been designed to run on **Git Bash (Windows)** or **Linux terminal** environments.

- Monitors system logs for warnings and errors
